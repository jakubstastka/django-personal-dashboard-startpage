# Django Personal Dashboard / Simple Start Page

This Django app provides the ability to create users and let them store their favourite bookmarks in several boards/groups.

This is a portfolio project that is in no shape or form meant to store critical/secret data.

## Why?

I wanted to create a single place that I could reach from any device connected to the internet to provide a starting point to the Internet.

There are ways to sync your bookmarks across multiple devices, but when it comes to multiple browsers, it might not be that easy. This is a webapp that solves my problem.

## Next steps

While the required functionality is already dare, I want the app to use React.
